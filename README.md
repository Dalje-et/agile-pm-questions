## Introduction

This repository consists the code to https://dalje-et.github.io/agile.github.io/. The developers of this project do not guarantee the correctness of the answers provided on the website. This is a community project. If you have more sample exam questions, please let us know so that we can include it. The sole purpose of this project is to help students that want to take the Agile PM Practicioner exam study.

## How does it work?

Great you ask! Quite simple actually. You open the page and type in a keyword of your question (do not copy paste the whole question since wordings can always change). A question consists of correct and wrong answers, marked green or red, respectively.

Note: your keyword will only apply to questions and not to the answers!

## How did you get the answers?

Well, we sat down and just thought reaaaaally hard about the questions and their answers.

## I see a question and I believe the answer you guys marked as correct is, in fact, wrong. What to do?

First of all, sorry if that is actually the case. Secondly, please open an issue/pull request so we can take proper actions. 

## Why did you do this?

For shits and giggles.

Enjoy!
